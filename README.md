A Frontend created for the Fast Delivery app in which you can order burgers, french fries and delicious ice cream. For the client side, I used the following technology stack: React, Redux Toolkit, Axios, Styled Componets.

========================= To run the application you need: =========================

Open the terminal. When you are in the client folder, enter the command "npm i". And after loading - "npm start" After that the application should work!
